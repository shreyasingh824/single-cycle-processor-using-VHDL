# single-cycle-processor-using-VHDL
The objective of this project is to design a single-cycle MIPS processor using VHDL and simulate it in Xilinx ISE. The processor will be able to execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA), including arithmetic and logical operations, memory access instructions, and control flow instructions.

This project aims to design and simulate a single-cycle MIPS processor using VHDL in Xilinx ISE.The design
will include a single-cycle architecture, where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle. The primary
goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a single-cycle MIPS processor using VHDL and evaluate
its performance characteristics through simulation. The project will also explore the challenges of designing
and implementing a processor using hardware description languages and Xilinx tools. Additionally, the
project will focus on achieving a balance between performance and area utilization, optimizing the design

for speed while minimizing the usage of resources. The processor will be verified through simulation, includ-
ing functional simulation and timing simulation to ensure correct operation and timing requirements are met.
