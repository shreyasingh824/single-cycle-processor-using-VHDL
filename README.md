# single-cycle-processor-using-VHDL
The objective of this project is to design a single-cycle MIPS processor using VHDL and simulate it in Xilinx ISE. The processor will be able to execute a subset of the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA), including arithmetic and logical operations, memory access instructions, and control flow instructions.
